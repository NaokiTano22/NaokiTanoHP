abstract: Recent advances in CT/X-ray imaging technology and endoscopic resection have facilitated the detection and resection of small tumors in the lungs. Minimally invasive surgery, as typified by endoscopic surgery, is widely used because it is less burdensome and less painful for the patient. Since the information obtained from CT and X-ray images is insufficient to determine the extent of resection, it is necessary to determine the extent of micronodule resection through palpation before beginning surgery. However, patients with narrow chest cavities and small tumors have difficulty in determining the extent of resection by palpation. Therefore, in this study, we propose a tumor exploration scope with an air chamber as a method to determine the tumor location instead of palpation. This scope has multiple chambers made of silicone in the head. A barometric sensor connected to each air chamber measures the internal pressure to obtain reaction force information for each chamber and determine the location of the tumor. After designing the scope, a single chamber test was conducted to determine the shape of the air chamber. After that, experiments using phantom tissue with a sensor head that combines multiple air chambers were conducted to examine the effectiveness of this scope.
