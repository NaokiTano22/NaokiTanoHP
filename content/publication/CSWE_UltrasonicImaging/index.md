abstract: "This study addresses a crucial necessity in the field of noninvasive liver fibrosis diagnosis by introducing the concept of continuous shear wave elastography (C-SWE), utilizing an external vibration source and color Doppler imaging. However, an application of C-SWE to assess liver elasticity, a deep region within the human body, arises an issue of signal instability in the obtained data. To tackle this challenge, this work proposes a method involving the acquisition of multiple frames of datasets, which are subsequently compressed. Furthermore, the proposed frame-to-frame equalization method compensates discrepancies in the initial phase that might exist among multiple-frame datasets, thereby significantly enhancing signal stability. The experimental validation of this approach encompasses both phantom tests and in vivo experiments. In the phantom tests, the proposed technique is validated through a comparison with the established shear wave elastography (SWE) technique. The results demonstrate a remarkable agreement, with an error in shear wave velocity of less than 4.2%. Additionally, the efficacy of the proposed method is confirmed through in vivo tests. As a result, the stabilization of observed shear waves using the frame-to-frame equalization technique exhibits promising potential for accurately assessing human liver elasticity. These findings collectively underscore the viability of C-SWE as a potential diagnostic instrument for liver fibrosis."
