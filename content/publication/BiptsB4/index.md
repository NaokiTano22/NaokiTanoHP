abstract: In recent years, advances in CT scan technology have made it possible to detect small tumours in the lungs. Endoscopic thoracoscopic surgery is used to remove tiny tumours, and this technique can significantly reduce the burden on the patient by reducing operating time and the extent of the incision. However, the extent of resection has conventionally been determined by palpation. However, palpation is not possible when the tumour is located deep in the thoracic cavity or when the patient's thoracic cavity is narrow, as the surgeon's fingers cannot reach it. In this study, a scope with a pressure-sensitive sensor was developed as a device that can determine the resection area in place of the primary surgeon's finger, and the length of the indenter leg and sensitivity were investigated using a calibration system with a load.
