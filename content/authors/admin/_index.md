I'm a master's student of mechanical engineering at Tokyo Institute of Technology. My academic pursuits primarily revolve around translational research, with a strong focus on tactile sensing and elastography. Presently, my efforts are dedicated to developing a tumor detection scope for employment in minimally invasive surgical procedures. Upon completing my Master's degree, I will join Tabaru Lab. as a member of their PhD program, where I will delve into the realm of liver elastography.
