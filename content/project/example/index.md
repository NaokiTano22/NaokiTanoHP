This is my master's project at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Our cutting-edge research is to develop novel tactile sensor speciallized for tumor detection in scope surgery. By utilizing our proposed working principle, we aim to localize the tumor location in scope surgeries. This may lead to significant reduction in surgery time.

These days, scope surgeries become the preferred method due to its numerous advantages, such as smaller incisions, significant pain reduction, and shorter patient recovery time. However, compared to conventional open chest surgeries, these minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) present greater challenges for surgeons. The limited information available in MIS procedures, caused by the narrow workspace through small ports, creates certain difficulties in operations and decision-making. This limitation stems from the lack of direct visualization of the operative site, which restricts access to visual information. Additionally, MIS completely lacks tactile sensation, which is crucial for tumor localization. As a result, the available information during MIS is severely limited, posing challenges for surgeons in making accurate decisions and performing operations. 

To address the issue of lacking tactile information, we present a novel pneumatic tactile sensor that is specialized for tumor detection. The proposed sensor incorporates multiple balloons in the scope head to accurately capture the distribution of tissue hardness within a single sensing protocol. By enabling the assessment of hardness distribution, tissue palpation can be done in a short period. Furthermore, this pneumatic approach ensures minimal tissue damage due to its high compressibility and flexibility. In addition, the sensor meets the requirements for MIS, with a diameter of only 20 mm, and allows for easy fabrication and sterilization.
