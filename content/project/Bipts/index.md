This is my master's project at Tokyo Institute of Technology. Our cutting-edge research is to develop balloons-incorporated tactile sensor speciallized for tumor detection in scope surgery. By utilizing our proposed working principle, we aim to localize the tumor location in scope surgeries. This may lead to significant reduction in surgery time.
