abstract: In recent years, advances in technologies such as CT scanning have enabled the detection of small tumors in the lungs. Thoracoscopic surgery using endoscopy is performed for the removal of these small tumors. This technique significantly reduces the surgical time and incision area, thus minimizing the burden on patients. However, the determination of the resection area has traditionally relied on the surgeon's palpation. In cases where tumors are located deep within the chest cavity or when the patient's chest cavity is narrow, the surgeon's fingers may not reach, making palpation impossible. In this study, we have developed a device with a pressure sensor-equipped scope to determine the surgical area in place of the surgeon's fingers. We also investigated the pressure sensor leg length and sensitivity using a calibration system with weights.
