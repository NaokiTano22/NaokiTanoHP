abstract: Previous work on Continuous Shear Wave Elastography (C-SWE) has reported its superior S/N ratio compared to conventional SWE. This is attributed to the enhanced tissue displacements induced by the external vibrator, easing the measurement of liver lies in deeper areas of the human body. However, the reflective waves from continuous vibration, coupled with three-dimensional vibrations transmitted from ribs and blood vessels, may interfere with the incident waves as a component near the DC range in the spectrogram. Therefore, this study introduces an adaptive Gaussian filter designed to remove reflective wave influence, improving C-SWE reliability for the diagnosis.
