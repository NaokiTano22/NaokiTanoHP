abstract: "Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a lifestyle disease often linked to obesity, is highly prevalent and can lead to severe complications such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis. Given the association of NASH with liver fibrosis, there is a growing need for noninvasive diagnostic methods to assess liver viscoelasticity. Ultrasound-based measurement of tissue viscoelasticity has been the subject of numerous studies over an extended period. We developed continuous shear wave elastography (C-SWE) for diagnosis on liver fibrosis, which utilizes an external vibrator to excite the shear wave. However, extensive in-vivo experiments are necessary to comprehensively optimize the performance of C-SWE, assess its robustness, and expedite the computation. In this study, we present the development of a Doppler signal simulator for the proposed method, C-SWE. To investigate and enhance the performance of the algorithm, intentional noise was incorporated into the simulator. The simulation process is elaborated upon in the subsequent section, and the results obtained are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of this simulation algorithm. Moreover, we assess the robustness of the algorithm by evaluating its performance under the varying intentional noise conditions."
