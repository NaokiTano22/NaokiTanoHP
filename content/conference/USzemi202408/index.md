abstract: Continuous Shear Wave Elastography visualizes tissue elasticity based on shear wave velocity by an external vibrator. In liver imaging, the vibrator and ultrasound prove are placed at the ninth intercostal space. Vibration of ribs generates shear wave components which are not parallel to the imaging plane. This study proposes a filter to remove these non-parallel components, extracting parallel components for shear wave velocity measurement. The filter adapts its parameters based on shear wave speed, propagation direction, and signal intensity, enabling stable biological signal measurement. The proposed filter’s validity was confirmed through phantom and volunteer tests.
