abstract: This study introduces a multiple-balloon integrated sensor scope for detecting tumors in Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) The proposed tumor detecting scope clears limited size of through-hole aperture for MIS. Notably, to the best of our knowledge, the proposed balloon-integrated scope marks the first instance that fulfills the size requirement, a diameter of less than 20 mm, and sterilization prerequisites, as well as simultaneously delivering pressure distribution. Furthermore, we have empirically established its efficacy, with the reported detection capabilities exceeding 5 mm in diameter with an AUC of 1.00. Phantom tests have also confirmed a translational sensitivity of less than 2.5 mm.
