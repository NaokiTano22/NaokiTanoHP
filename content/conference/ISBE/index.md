abstract: Minimally invasive surgeries (MIS), represented by endoscopic surgeries, have become widespread due to advantages of smaller incisions, reduced pain, and shortened rehabilitation periods compared to conventional open chest surgeries [1]. However, MISs face a significant challenge in the complete loss of tactile information. The lack of tactile information makes it difficult for the surgeon to locate tumors through palpation and determine the resection area. Therefore, in this study, we have developed a pressure-sensitive scope designed for detecting tumors.
